 This app is supposed to have at least three standard search buttons
 along wih one search button itself.

 When the button a standard button is clicked it is to produce 10 images
 that are moving until clicked on and then they become animated.

 There is also a search button that you can search any gif's you want and then
 add the search as a regular button.

 There is also supposed to be a ratings process that will make sure there is nothing inapproriate.
